# Outdoor Explorer

## Idea:

Outdoor Explorer is a community of travellers for travellers. It is a place for you to tell others where you’ve been and what you enjoyed. It is also a place for you to see where others have been and what they liked. 

It is focused on motivating you to leave the office and explore the world by suggesting places you may like. 


“Share your adventures with like-minded travellers and adventurers!”


## Motivation:

The author is a travel enthusiast with a desire to create a community where travellers can share their experiences with different types of destinations, in one place, and explore further what others have visited, enjoyed or plan to visit with the goal to explore more.
