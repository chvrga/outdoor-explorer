<name>Caminito del Rey</name>
<country>Spain</country>
<description>El Chorro gorge is particularly famous for the Caminito del Rey (King's Path) so named because Alfonso XIII walked along it when he opened the Guadalhorce hydroelectric dam in 1921. The path had fallen into severe disrepair by the late 1990s and became famously known as the most dangerous pathway in the world. After extensive restoration and a €5.5 million tab, it reopened in March 2015 and is now reputedly entirely safe and open to anyone with a reasonable head for heights.

The path hangs 100m above the river Guadalhorce and snakes around the cliffs, affording truly breathtaking views at every turn. The boardwalk is 2.9km long and constructed with a wooden slats and a 1.2m-high three-wire guard rail; in some sections the old crumbling path can be spied just below. There is a lot of information on the website, including reservation details. You should allow around four hours for the walk which includes returning to your access point. Note that the walk is linear, however there are regular buses that can take you back to your start point (€1.55, 20 minutes).

The most convenient public transport to the area is the train from Málaga which leaves eight times daily to Alora (40 minutes, €3.60). Check www.renfe.com for the timetable.</description>
