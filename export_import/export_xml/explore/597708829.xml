<description>In a deep valley a few kilometres east of Carvoeiro is the little fishing village of Benagil. The beach here is possibly a clue as to what Carvoeiro was like many years ago. However, at Benagil there is still a busy little fishing fleet with boats that can be seen pulled up on the beach at the bottom of the slipway.</description>
