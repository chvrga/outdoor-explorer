<name>Porto Côvo</name>
<country>Portugal</country>
<description>The appealingly ‘traditional cute’ Porto Côvo is worth a quick visit if you have the time. Perched on low cliffs with views over the sea, Porto Côvo is a former fishing village with a pretty square, cobbled streets lined with sun-bleached houses and a popular beach. </description>
