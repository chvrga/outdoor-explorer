<name>Praia da Rocha</name>
<country>Portugal</country>
<description>Five minutes' drive from Portim√£o, Praia da Rocha has one of the Algarve's best beaches, backed by ochre-red cliffs and the small 16th-century Fortaleza da Santa Catarina.Behind the beach looms the town; this has long known the hand of development, with high-rise condos and luxury hotels sprouting along the cliffside, and a row of restaurants, bars and clubs packed along the main thoroughfare. </description>
