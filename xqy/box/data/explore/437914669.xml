<country>Germany</country>
<description>Who else can say they hiked a sea of rocks? This hike is filled with ancient Roman works hidden near the trail, and is great fun for those who like to climb.

You can park your car at the Felsenmeer Informationzentrum, or take a bus into the small town Reichenbach and walk the rest. Parking fees are 3€ for cars and 5€ for buses. Make sure to use the bathroom before the hike, it's 50 cents inside the information center.

For those who like to follow an organized path you can take the trail head called Siegfriedsquelle (3.2 km) all the way to the top. But the most fun is found climbing the huge boulders to the very top (1.1 km). Sure footedness is definitely required. There are 8 stopping points on the trail, it took my group about 3 hours to reach the very last stop. We were distracted by the insane views, and stopped to eat lunch. When you reach the top don't expect an extravagant opening to view the countryside. There are a couple of openings within the trees to get a good glimpse, but the most beauty is found during the hike itself. It's easier and less stress on the knees to take the Siegfriedsquelle trail on the way down. Round trip this epic journey was about 4.3 km.

If you're lucky, the beer &amp; wurst hut will be open located about halfway to the top. But no worries there's a restaurant at the top as well!</description>
